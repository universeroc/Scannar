# Scannar

Scannar is very simple but effective app to open what you are reading on PC web browser by scanning QR.

# How to use it

AS this is an only basic and simple app that I have not published to AppStore, you could clone *Scannar* to your Mac and build it 
with XCode  7 beta 4 then run on your iPhone. If you don't know how to use the new XCode feature that you can visit [HOW TO RUN YOUR APPS ON YOUR IPHONE USING XCODE 7](http://yupengzhang.com/how-to-run-your-apps-on-your-iphone-using-xcode-7/) for detail.

# Why you need it

Wechat has already integrated this feature in its top-right corner "+". You could easily open Wechat and click "+" then select
the third menu item to use it.

I don't like this experience as there's too many steps to use it.

Secondly what you scan by Wechat is not directly openend afterwards but filtered by Wechat, in the result, some pages could not open
 successfully because it does not satisfy Wechat's rules.
 
It's more safe but to me it's annoying.

So I create Scannar.
